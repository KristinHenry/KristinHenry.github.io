<h1>Before Covid hit, I made a bunch of stickers to give away at conferences and shows.</h1>

But they all were cancelled...because of Covid. What was I going to do with all these stickers?<br /><br />At the same time, our USPS was under attack. I needed to do something, no matter how small.<br /><br />I started mailing stickers to friends, and asked them to tell me when they arrived.<br /><br />After a few weeks, I had a small, but promising, date set.<br /><br />So I opened up signups to the general public, and started mailing more of my stickers.

I was going to give these away at conferences and shows that were cancelled because of Covid...<br><br>I started mailing them to friends, and tracking how long it took my envelopes to travel from my local Post Office here in San Francisco to their destinations.

From the beginning, this project has been a combination of modern technology and personal tangible hand-written notes in hand-addressed envelopes. Participants sign up with an online form, which I can then save to a spreadsheet for tracking when mail is sent and recieved (communicated by email).

For me, the greatest treasures of this project have been the human contact during a global pandemic and quarantine.

2020 was a rough year in so many ways. The relentless news cycle, ubiquitous uncertainty, social isolation, existential dread, and so much more. All amplified by social media.

The attack on the US Postal Service hit me harder than I expected it to. I felt driven to buy as many stamps as I could, to support the USPS.

At some point, I found myself staring at the pile of art stickers I was going to give away at conferences and showsâ€¦all cancelled because Covid.

What was I going to do with them? Could I mail them to people?

I started with a little group of artist-friends and set up an online signup form, so they could send me their mailing addresses privately.

With perfect timing, the USPS was about to release new stamps honoring local artist Ruth Asawa, just as I was launching an art+data project from right in her neighborhood.


The process of writing little notes and addressing the envelopes by hand was surprisingly soothing. I started inviting more people to signup, and asked them to tell me when their sticker arrived. Before I knew it, I had a tiny data set of delivery times for US mail. By profession, I develop data visualizations. So, of course I started charting the data.
